We know that we're looking on the other side and the other side
And it's gotta be late on the other side all day long
It's gonna be time for the other side and the other side
We know that we're looking on the other side and the other side

When we have the friends that they're not doing enough
When we need some love, you know you've been around

But now I'm on the other side
When we need some love, you know you've been around
In a town we're getting older
When we need some love, you know you've been around

You know my heart is so cold
You know my heart is so cold
And now I'm on the other side
You know my heart is so cold
And now I'm on the other side
When we need some love, you know you've been around

You know my heart is so cold
And now I'm on the other side
When we kiss 'cause you're all around
You know my heart is so cold

A second time when she's gone
I'm feeling like no one else to blame
It's not real when you're gone
I've seen you smile
You're not alone
You're breaking my heart
I'm losing my life
And I'm feeling like no one else to blame

Does it feel that you really seem to break it
Sedus more than I can't do
And I'm lost in a state
I just hate it feels like this
But I wish I could tell you
That you'd be here tonight
I just want to be here tonight
Maybe in some other way
To feel it here tonight
I might be here tonight
Maybe in some other way
I'll be here tonight
Maybe in some other way

Sometimes I think you're to go to bed
Maybe in some other way
I'll be here tonight
I'll be here tonight
I'll be here tonight
Maybe in some other way
And someday in some other way
And soon in some other way
And soon in some other way
To feel it there
And soon in some other way

But I know I'm half of my friends
And I'm sure you'll be sure
And then you went and said you'd better be with me
And you were just some problems
And I'm sure you're to go to bed

Cause I'm sure you're to go to bed
And maybe there is a place I can do
