And I know I'm lost
I've felt it before
But they've tried to stay
I've been so long
But I could try to hide
The things, the things
The things are on my own

Are you sitting by my side?

And I know I'm lost
I've been so long
But I can try to hide
The things are on my own

Are you dancing by my side?

But I know I'm lost
I've been so long
And I know I'm lost

But I'm lost

Baby, I've been digging the words to call a girl like you

Something I knew you had yesterday
One, and

You said we were a dream

But it was the reason
The same old
And it was the reason

I'd have to have the time
To get away from you
Like I used to feel about
I would have to have the time
To get away from you

It's a lie when I think I've been spending a lot of fun
Take my soul with a tongue
My heart is an ice
It's a lie when I looked at you
For yourself you're still not ready
Sing my voice
Come to my heart and go out
Just like a child who is meant to be

And I know that I am
So long to be in this way
I just can't wait
I'm still here on with you
And I know that I am
You gotta help me
I'm just as well
I'm still here on with you
I'm still here on with you
For yourself you're still not ready
